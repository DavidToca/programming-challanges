easy problem (somehow c simulation solution doesn't work, any ideas why?)
tricky part, they don't say i<j, so swap if i>j
using DP seams good strategy, but simulation is faster to code and get the job done
this problem shows how  slowly is java, you have to be very carefull with reading from stdin
and you HAVE TO use DP to solve problem, otherwise you will get TLE.

BTW naming input variables as i and j, make thinks kind of confusing in loops,
I promess not do that again.
